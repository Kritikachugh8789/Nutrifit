About us
Hi, I a, a clinical nutritionist who is here to help 
everyone lead a medicine free life.
I don't believe in strict nutrtion philosophies,
staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself
of the food you love. Rather, I encourage the use of
food as medicine with a holistic approach.

1. Personalised, non resrtictive diet and lifestyle plans.
2. No exotic or expensive items only homely food.

FAQs
1. Why do I need a dietician?
    You need a dietician to lead a healthy lifestyle. 
    A dietician takes time to learn about you and your lifestyle and 
    accordingly prepares a plan that would help you to achieve 
    your ideal body goals and at the same time helps you to prevent 
    from chronic diseases like heart attack, high blood pressure and many more.
2. Does a dietician only helps with weight loss?
    No, a dietician's job not only entitles preparing diets but also 
    giving advise about lifestyle alteration if need be. Nutrifit by Kritika
    offers a variety of diet plans other than weight loss like diabetes,
    thyroid, PWS, child nutrtion and many more.
3. How to choose between different types of cooking oil?
    Each oil has its own benefits. Ideally we should change our oils 
    regularly so that we may not miss out on any benefit.
